# Haxe Node.JS

## Overview

Extern type definitions for Node.JS version **0.12.0**

Haxe-generated API documentation is available at http://haxefoundation.github.io/hxnodejs/js/Node.html.

Original node.js documentation can be found at http://nodejs.org/api/index.html.

## Status

This library is currently at **beta** stage, testing and contributions are welcome. See [current issues](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/hxnodejs/issues) and [extern guidelines](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/hxnodejs/blob/master/HOWTO.md). After it's finished, it will either be included in Haxe standard library or released as a separate haxelib.

Requires Haxe 3.2RC1 or later (builds available at http://builds.haxe.org/)
