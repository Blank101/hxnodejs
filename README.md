# Haxe Node.JS

## Overview

Extern classes for Node.JS version **0.10.32**

Full documentation can be found in the **[Node.JS API Docs](http://nodejs.org/api/index.html)**.

## Status

This library is currently **incomplete and of work-in-progress quality**, however testing and contributions are welcome. See [current issues](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/hxnodejs/issues). After it's finished, it will either be included in Haxe standard library or released as a separate haxelib.
