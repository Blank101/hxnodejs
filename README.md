# Haxe Node.JS

## Overview

Extern classes for Node.JS version **0.12.0**

Full documentation can be found in the **[Node.JS API Docs](http://nodejs.org/api/index.html)**.

## Status

This library is currently at **beta** stage, testing and contributions are welcome. See [current issues](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/hxnodejs/issues) and [extern guidelines](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/hxnodejs/blob/master/HOWTO.md). After it's finished, it will either be included in Haxe standard library or released as a separate haxelib.

Requires latest GIT version of Haxe (builds available at http://builds.haxe.org/)
